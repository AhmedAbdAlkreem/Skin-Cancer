# Skin-Cancer
In this project we work to extraction features from Images using CNN and build the Neural Network to arrive the patient have skin-cancer Malignant or Benign.


What will learn before end this project?
1) How to deal with Images and read it?
2) Using opencv to deal with Images.
3) Read training and testing dataset.
4) Build Function to transform images to matrix.
5) Build another Function to solve the path of images.
6) Read training and testing dataset.
7) Splitting dataset to Training, Validation and Testing.
8) Extraction feature from Images using CNN.
9) Build the Neural Network and specific hidden layers.
10) Represent diagrams of loss and accuracy of dataset.
11) Calculate the accuracy of Model.
12) In this step you build complete Deep neural network.

Before end this project we can build any complete project using CNN.
